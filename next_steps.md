üí¨ CONVERSATION STARTERS FOR NEW CHAT
Choose based on what you want to build:
For Building Clark:

"Let's create Clark, the CEO Custom GPT. I need the complete instructions, personality, and API action configurations for ChatGPT."

For Voice Commands:

"Help me create Apple Shortcuts that connect to my Blair AI API for voice-controlled task creation."

For Dashboard:

"I want to build a simple web dashboard that displays my tasks and projects from the Blair AI API."

For Expanding API:

"Let's add more endpoints to my Railway API - I want to implement update, delete, and project management."

For Testing:

"Show me how to test my Blair AI system with real family scenarios and create automation workflows."


üîß TECHNICAL CONTEXT TO PROVIDE
If the assistant needs context, mention:

API is Node.js/Express on Railway
Using Notion API SDK v2.2.13
Port 8080, auto-deploy from GitHub
All databases use underscore naming (tasks_master, etc.)
Environment variable: NOTION_API_KEY


üìÅ PROJECT FILES TO REFERENCE
Mention you have these documented:

INFRASTRUCTURE.md - Complete system overview
package.json - Dependencies
src/index.js - API router code
railway.json - Deployment config


üöÄ RECOMMENDED FIRST ACTION
Start with Clark (CEO) because:

Central coordinator for all other agents
Highest budget authority ($1000)
Most versatile for testing
Gateway to other agents
